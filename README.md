# Predicting Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Nepal.
To develop a comprehensive system for predicting Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), you'll need to follow a structured approach that includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to go about building a predictive system for COPD as a data scientist:
## Objectives
    - Collect and preprocess data relevant to COPD.
    - Identify and engineer significant features contributing to COPD.
    - Develop a predictive model to estimate the risk of COPD.
    - Evaluate the model's performance and refine it.
    - Deploy the model for practical use in a clinical or public health setting.
